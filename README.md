# Oilfield Calculations

Our team formed mid-April 2017 as Tomagocha. We are students of [The Houston Coding Bootcamp Powered by UT Austin](https://houston.codingbootcamp.utexas.edu/).

As residents of Houston, Texas, we all have close ties to the oilfield. This prompted our thinking toward solutions for oilfield personnel.

## Contributors

Our team is Taylor Feinstein, Lonnie White, Rochelle Beal and Bon Crowder. If you'd like to join the development team, see the information about contributing below.
